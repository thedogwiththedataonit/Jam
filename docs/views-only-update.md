# Views-Only Update Summary

## Changes Made

This update removes all tracking and storing of likes, comments, and shares data from the TikTok CPM Analyzer. The app now focuses exclusively on views data for analytics.

### 1. Updated Data Structures

#### TikTokVideo Interface
- **Removed**: `likes`, `comments`, `shares` from stats
- **Kept**: Only `views` in stats

#### TikTokData Interface
- **Removed**: `totalLikes` from user stats
- **Kept**: `followers` in user stats

#### AnalyticsData Interface
- **Removed**: `likesStandardDeviation`, `engagementRate`
- **Kept**: Views-based metrics only

### 2. Parser Updates (`tiktokParser.ts`)

- Removed all code that extracts likes, comments, and shares data
- Removed likes extraction from both HTML elements and JSON scripts
- Updated logging to exclude likes data
- Updated `formatTikTokData` to only include views in video stats

### 3. Analytics Updates (`CPMAnalyzer.tsx`)

- Removed engagement rate calculations
- Removed likes standard deviation calculations
- Removed the "Engagement Rate" metric card
- Changed grid from 4 columns to 3 columns for key metrics
- Removed the likes chart completely
- Made the views chart full-width with increased height (400px)
- Updated recommendations to remove engagement-based suggestions

### 4. UI Changes

**Before**: 
- 4 metric cards (Average Views, CPM, Virality Rate, Engagement Rate)
- 2 charts side by side (Views and Likes)

**After**:
- 3 metric cards (Average Views, CPM, Virality Rate)
- 1 full-width chart (Views only)

### 5. What Remains

The app still tracks and analyzes:
- **Views per video**: Primary metric for all calculations
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**: Cost per thousand views
- **Virality Rate**: Based on views exceeding mean + 2 standard deviations
- **Performance Consistency**: Based on views variability
- **User followers count**: For context (not used in calculations)

### 6. Export Data

The exported JSON now contains:
- User data (without totalLikes)
- Video data with only views in stats
- All analytics based on views only

## Testing the Changes

1. The app will no longer display any likes, comments, or shares data
2. Console logs will show parsed data without likes information
3. Exported JSON will only contain views data for videos
4. All calculations are now purely based on video views
