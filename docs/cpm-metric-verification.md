# CPM Metric Verification

## Metrics Collected

The app now collects and displays the following view-related metrics:

### 1. Total Views
- **What it is**: The sum of all views across the last X videos analyzed
- **Where displayed**: In the metric cards at the top of the results
- **Formula**: `totalViews = Σ(views for each video)`

### 2. Average Views per Video
- **What it is**: The mean number of views per video
- **Where displayed**: In the metric cards and used for CPM calculation
- **Formula**: `averageViews = totalViews / numberOfVideos`

### 3. CPM (Cost Per Mille)
- **What it is**: The cost per thousand views
- **Where displayed**: In the metric cards with detailed breakdown in insights
- **Formula**: `CPM = (costPerVideo / averageViews) × 1000`

## CPM Calculation Verification

The CPM calculation is correct and follows industry standards:

1. **Input**: Cost per video (e.g., $500)
2. **Calculate**: Average views per video (e.g., 100,000 views)
3. **Result**: CPM = ($500 / 100,000) × 1000 = $5.00

This means you're paying $5.00 for every 1,000 views.

## Console Logging

When analyzing a profile, the console will show:
```
=== CPM CALCULATION ===
Videos analyzed: 10
Total views: 1,000,000
Average views per video: 100,000
Cost per video: $500
CPM (Cost per 1,000 views): $5.00
```

## UI Updates

1. **Metric Cards**: Now shows 4 cards:
   - Total Views (with count of videos analyzed)
   - Average Views (per video)
   - CPM (cost per 1,000 views)
   - Virality Rate

2. **Performance Insights**: Added "Views Analysis" section showing:
   - Number of videos analyzed
   - Total views across all videos
   - Average views per video

3. **Cost Efficiency**: Added CPM breakdown formula showing:
   - `$[cost] per video ÷ [avg views] avg views × 1,000 = $[CPM]`

## Export Data

The exported JSON now includes:
- `totalViews`: Total views across analyzed videos
- `averageViews`: Average views per video
- `cpmExplanation`: A text explanation of how CPM was calculated

## Industry Standards for CPM

- **< $5**: Highly cost-effective
- **$5-$15**: Industry standard
- **> $15**: Above average cost

The app correctly categorizes creators based on these benchmarks.
